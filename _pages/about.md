I am a Computer Science graduate student and research assistant at [Colorado State University (CSU)](https://www.colostate.edu). I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/). Prior to CSU, I was at the [University of Nevada, Las Vegas](https://unlv.edu) for one year, earning experience on both teaching and research. Also, I had been an NLP Research Assistant and AI Developer at [CommentMiner](http://www.commentminer.ir/) (2017-2018).

I am interested in Natural Language Processing, Neural Language Representation and generally Machine Learning for natural language text.
