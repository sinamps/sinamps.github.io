I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student and research fellow in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). I graduated from [Colorado State University (CSU)](https://www.colostate.edu) with a M.S. in Computer Science in 2022. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/). After my undegraduate studies, I was at the [University of Nevada, Las Vegas](https://unlv.edu) for one year, earning experience on both teaching and research. Also, I was an NLP Developer and Research Assistant at [CommentMiner](http://www.commentminer.ir/) from 2017 to 2018.

I am interested in Natural Language Processing (Interpretability, Multimodality, and Neural Language Representation) and generally Machine Learning for natural language text.
