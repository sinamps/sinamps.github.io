I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student and research assistant in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) where I am glad to be advised by Prof. [Saday Sadayappan](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~saday/). I have been an AI Scientist co-op and intern at [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com/) from 2024 to 2025. I graduated from [Colorado State University (CSU)](https://www.colostate.edu) with a M.S. in Computer Science in 2022. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/). After my undergraduate studies, I was at the [University of Nevada, Las Vegas](https://unlv.edu) for one year, earning experience in both teaching and research. Also, I was an NLP Developer and Research Assistant at [CommentMiner](http://www.commentminer.ir/) from 2017 to 2018.

I am interested in High-Performance Artificial Intelligence. Topics in system and compiler optimizations and distributed training/inference for AI frameworks intrigue me.
