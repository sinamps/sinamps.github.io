__Current Projects__
------
* Investigating the Application of VLAD to NLP (case study on Irony/Sarcasm Detection in Twitter)
  * Venue: [Dept. of Computer Science](https://compsci.colostate.edu/), [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/)
  * Description: Investigating the application and effectiveness of vector of locallay aggregated descriptors on top of Transformer-based language representation layers; Stuyding Irony/Sarcasm detection as a use case.
* Social Media Bot Identification using Deepfake Text Detection
  * Venue: [Dept. of Computer Science](https://compsci.colostate.edu/), [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/)
  * Description: Applying Transformer-based models to detect bot-generated text on a deepfake dataset. 
* Claim/Counterclaim detection in Social Media
  * Venue: [Dept. of Computer Science](https://compsci.colostate.edu/), [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/)
  * Description: Designing a pipeline to detect claim and counterclaims in social media incorporating Natural Language Inference, Stance Detection, and Claim Detection; In Twitter and Youtube; Working on publishing an annotated COVID-19-related claim/counterclaim dataset from YouTube comments.

__B. Sc. Project__
------
* Implementation of a Convolutional and a Pooling Layer of a CNN on FPGA
  * Venue: [Dept. of Computer Engineering and Information Technology](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en), [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/)
  * Description: In this research, I implemented the convolutional and the max pooling functions of CNN's using [Xilinx](https://www.xilinx.com/) Vivado High-Level Synthesis and ran this project on a ZYBO SoC board. This design acheived up to 30 times faster throughput relative to the software code on a CPU.
  * Notes: The English abstract is available [here](https://sinamps.github.io/files/English%20Abstract.pdf). My [dissertation](https://sinamps.github.io/files/Sina_Mahdipour_Report1.pdf) and the [presentation slides](https://sinamps.github.io/files/Slides.pptx) are available in Persian.
