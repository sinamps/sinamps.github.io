__B. Sc. Project__
------
* Implementation of a Convolutional and a Pooling Layer of a CNN on FPGA
 * Venue: [Dept. of Computer Engineering and Information Technology](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en), [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/)
 * Description: I worked on accelerating main functions of CNN's using FPGA on a ZYBO board. In this research, I implemented the convolutional and the max pooling functions using [Xilinx](https://www.xilinx.com/) Vivado High-Level Synthesis and ran this project on a ZYBO SoC board. This design acheived up to 30 times faster throughput relative to the software code on a CPU.
 * Notes: The English abstract is available [here](https://sinamahdipour.github.io/files/English%20Abstract.pdf). My [dissertation](https://sinamahdipour.github.io/files/Sina_Mahdipour_Report1.pdf) and the [presentation slides](https://sinamahdipour.github.io/files/Slides.pptx) are available in Persian.
